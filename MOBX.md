# What is MobX used for?

MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. The strategy to achieve that is simple: Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.

MobX is a simple and scalable state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with React. It enables reactive programming, making it easy to manage and synchronize application state with the UI. Here's a breakdown of MobX, how to use it, and its benefits compared to Context API, Reducer, and Redux.

## Key Concepts of MobX

Observables: State variables that MobX tracks. Changes in observables automatically trigger updates to dependent computations or reactions.
Actions: Methods that modify the state. In MobX, you explicitly mark state-modifying methods as actions.
Reactions: These are side-effects that automatically run when the state changes, similar to useEffect in React.
Computed values: Derived values that are automatically updated when observables they depend on change.

### How to Use MobX with React

1. Install MobX and MobX-React:
   npm install mobx mobx-react-lite

2. Create a Store: A store is an object containing the state and actions.

<script>
import { makeAutoObservable } from 'mobx';

class TodoStore {
  todos = [];

  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this);
  }

  addTodo(todo) {
    this.todos.push(todo);
  }

  removeTodo(index) {
    this.todos.splice(index, 1);
  }
}

const todoStore = new TodoStore();
export default todoStore;
</script>

3. Use the Store in Components:

<script>
import React from 'react';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';
import todoStore from './TodoStore';

const TodoList = observer(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todoStore.todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={() => todoStore.addTodo('New Task')}>
        Add Todo
      </button>
    </div>
  );
});

export default TodoList;
</script>

Benefits of MobX over Context, Reducer, and Redux
Simplicity: MobX allows you to write less boilerplate code compared to Redux. The code is more straightforward and easier to follow, without needing action types, reducers, or middleware.

Automatic Reactions: MobX tracks dependencies automatically. If a component depends on an observable, it will re-render only when that specific observable changes, which minimizes unnecessary re-renders.

Scalability: MobX scales well for larger applications because you can split stores easily, and each store manages its state independently.

Flexibility: You can structure your state in any way you want with MobX, while Redux enforces a specific structure (e.g., having a single global store).

Better performance: With MobX’s fine-grained reactivity, components only re-render when specific observables they use change, whereas Redux triggers a re-render for the entire tree.

Downsides of MobX
Learning Curve: The reactive programming model can be unfamiliar to developers used to the unidirectional data flow in Redux.

Debugging: The automatic nature of MobX can make debugging challenging since the flow of data and reactions isn’t as explicit as in Redux.

Conclusion
MobX is a powerful and flexible alternative to Redux, Context API, and useReducer for state management, especially for applications that require fine-grained reactivity or have complex state dependencies. It’s an excellent choice for developers who prioritize simplicity and minimal boilerplate. However, it might not be the best fit for teams already accustomed to the explicit structure of Redux.
